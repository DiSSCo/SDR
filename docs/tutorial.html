<h1>Digitisation tutorial</h1>
<p>Hello new SDR user! This tutorial will take you through the basic process of using the SDR:
  * Uploading an input file to the SDR
  * Launching the workflow to perform the digitisation
  * Viewing and saving the digitisation output</p>
<h2>Getting ready</h2>
<p>For this tutorial, please download and use the following <a href="reference-file.csv" title="SDR reference file">reference file</a>. If you have already following this tutorial and are interested in creating your own input files, please see this <a href="create-new-input-file.md" title="SDR new input file guide">guide</a> to creating your own input files.</p>
<h2>Uploading input file</h2>
<p>The SDR is driven by supplying an input file. This file contains some basic details about the sample to be digitised and, crucially, a URL pointing to the specimen image itself. Each column of the file corresponds to an element of metadata and each row of the file is a sample to be analysed.</p>
<p>To allow the SDR to process our reference file, we must upload it to the SDR interface. </p>
