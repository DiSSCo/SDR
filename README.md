# Specimen Data Refinery (SDR)
We are using this repo for both SDR project management and technical development work.

Ben and Laurence are transfering the next steps from the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) document into GitHub [issues](https://github.com/DiSSCo/SDR/issues). 

We are using GitHub's simple Project Trello boards to track [Publications and Outputs](https://github.com/DiSSCo/SDR/projects/2) and development of the [MVP](https://github.com/DiSSCo/SDR/projects/1).

We have a separate repo for [SDR datasets](https://github.com/DiSSCo/sdr-datasets)
